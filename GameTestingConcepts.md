## Important skill for a game tester
  After watching both Halo 3: The Testing videos two skills that I think a game are:
* Thinking like the people who are going to use your product
* Seeing how one addition or change may cause seemingly unrelated problems

  In relation to the Halo 3: The Testing videos, being able to think like the users allowed them to proactively search for bugs or exploits that may not be a direct result of bad programming or that may simply not be obvious things to look for; in their case, that meant doing things such as jumping up trees to try to escape the map. Had they not engaged in that type of testing then it may have led to high levels of exploiting on multiplayer where players jump out of the map to snipe from unintended locations. Had they neglicted those tests in single player it had the potential for people to skip important parts of levels by simply skipping to a later point in the level. 
  
  Being able to see how simple changes to things such as pacing or balancing can cause a wide range of other bugs is another important skill for a tester. Once again using Halo 3: The Testing as a reference it's quite evident how important of a skill this is. In the videos, they described how slightly increasing the speed of a vehicle could everyone in the vehicle to die if they drove off ramps of a certain height. If they didn't immediately test all functionality of that vehicle after adjusting its speed, they may have not found that bug for some time, and by then it may not have been obvious what had caused it in the first place, making their jobs even harder in the long run. 
  
## Hardest part about being a tester
  From watching that video I think perhaps the hardest part about being a tester is staying focussed. They described having to check every color in the customization menu and make sure that each and every one of them worked properly. They also talked about having to try every functionality of every feature, such as weapons, whenever a change was made to ensure that whatever change had been made did not cause any new bugs. I understand why all of this is necessary and how testing so thouroughly can improve a game's performance and enjoyability, but I can't help but to think that that level of tediousness wouldn't start to wear thin and make you lose focus very quickly. 

## What I found interesting

  The thing that I learned that I found the most interesting and surprising was how early on full-scale testing begins. I had always assumed that testing began early, but still some time after a project had started. Finding out that making use of a full testing team as soon as a project had begun was not something I was expecting to hear.
