## About TestingWhiz
TestingWhiz is an automated testing tool created by Cygnet Infotech. TestingWhiz supports a whole host of useful feature, one of which is  Visual Recorder. The Visual Recorder feature allows you to create a repeatable test by only performing it once. With the Visual Recorder, all you have to do is activate it and TestingWhiz will record your inputs and store it into a test that you can then have the computer repeat. This is would be extremely useful in many situations, such as for a quick smoke test that, while simple, would take more time to write a script for than it would be to simply perform the test once and have the program record it so you don't have to do the test again manually or create a script to run the test.

Another useful feature of TestingWhiz is internalization. TestingWhiz's internalization tool can translate code, reports and test cases into several different languages, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Dutch. The ability to translate from one language to another accross different functionalities such as case reports would allow for greatly improved communication and work flow between testers from different regions. 

The final feature I'd like to discuss is a job schedular. The job schedular allows the user to schedule when and how often to run certain tests. This feature significantly reduces the possibility of human error in testing since you wouldn't have to worry about anyone forgetting to run certain tests at certain times since you could easily set the test to run automatically at those times. 


## Further information
* Does TestingWhiz support test case storage? 
The answer is less straightforward than it should be. I was unable to find any specific information about storing test cases, however while researching TestingWhiz it did indirectly say that it could store test cases

* Does this TestingWhiz allow tester to link requirements or defects to test cases?
yes, it does allow you to link requirements to test cases. 

* does it work with web-based tools? What languages?
TestingWhiz does have web-based testing capabilities built in. It's focus is on codeless testing but it does support Java.
