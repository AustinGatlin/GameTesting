## About TestingWhiz
TestingWhiz is an automated testing tool created by Cygnet Infotech. TestingWhiz supports a whole host of useful feature, one of which is  Visual Recorder. The Visual Recorder feature allows you to create a repeatable test by only performing it once. With the Visual Recorder, all you have to do is activate it and TestingWhiz will record your inputs and store it into a test that you can then have the computer repeat. This is would be extremely useful in many situations, such as for a quick smoke test that, while simple, would take more time to write a script for than it would be to simply perform the test once and have the program record it so you don't have to do the test again manually or create a script to run the test.

Another useful feature of TestingWhiz is
