## Summary

Pharaoh is a city building game based around ancient Egypt. It is a mission based game with ever increasing difficulty and possibility. 
Pharaoh starts off incredibly simple, the first mission is building a few houses and tending to their needs so that they "improve", or upgrade. Each mission introducess a new challenge or game mechanic, with the early missions functioning as basic tutorials. For example, the beginning missions have you tyring to meet very basic goals, such as have a population of 500 and upgrade a certain number of houses to a relatively low level. Later missions, however, have you defending your city against enemy attacks, trying to increase certain attributes that reflect your entire city to a certain rank, and building monuments. 

Succeeding in Pharaoh requires keeping track of many things all at once. For example, you must have firehouses sprinkled throughout your city, if not, then your entire city will slowly start to burn down. Another aspect to keep track of is the gods of the game, representing certain gods from the Egyption pantheon. Each mission will feature certain gods, while not featuring others, and each of those gods governs a particular aspect of the game. Osiris, for example, controls the Nile River and by extension, crop supply. Fail to please Osiris and your crops will grow poorly and your farms will be whiped out.
