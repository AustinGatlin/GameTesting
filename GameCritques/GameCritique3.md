## Summary

Pharaoh is a city building game based around ancient Egypt. It is a mission based game with ever increasing difficulty and possibility. 
Pharaoh starts off incredibly simple, the first mission is building a few houses and tending to their needs so that they "improve", or upgrade. Each mission introducess a new challenge or game mechanic, with the early missions functioning as basic tutorials. For example, the beginning missions have you tyring to meet very basic goals, such as have a population of 500 and upgrade a certain number of houses to a relatively low level. Later missions, however, have you defending your city against enemy attacks, trying to increase certain attributes that reflect your entire city to a certain rank, and building monuments. 

Succeeding in Pharaoh requires keeping track of many things all at once. For example, you must have firehouses sprinkled throughout your city, if not, then your entire city will slowly start to burn down. Another aspect to keep track of is the gods of the game, representing certain gods from the Egyption pantheon. Each mission will feature certain gods, while not featuring others, and each of those gods governs a particular aspect of the game. Osiris, for example, controls the Nile River and by extension, crop supply. Fail to please Osiris and your crops will grow poorly and your farms will be whiped out. 


## What I would test 

1. The first, and perhaps one of the most important things I would test, is the worker maintanence system. Pharaoh requires that you have a number of different maintanence buildings spread throughout your city to keep it from being burned down, collapsing or being robbed. Making sure that each of the maintanence workers did their intended use (I.E. firemen preventing fires, architects preventing collapsed buildings) is an absolute must for Pharaoh. If firemen, for example, didn't reduce the risk of a fire starting by walking by a building, the entire game would be unplayable. Your city would slowly collapse or burn down and you could only rebuild fast enough for the next building to be destroyed. 

2. Another aspect of Pharaoh that I would test is it's save system. In Pharaoh, you can have multiple save profiles, or "families" which track your progress through the game, and through each mission. Since Pharaoh is a very, very long and difficult game, making sure that you can save and load is essential or else it would be essentially impossible to complete the game. 

3. The third mechaninc I would test in Pharaoh is improving housing. Besides simply being a requirement for certain missions, upgrading housing is an essential function in other ways as well, the more highly improved a house is, the more people can live in it, that can be the difference between a house only having two occupents and a house having thirty occupants. If houses didn't improve when the improvement requirements were met, then your city would have to be far more spread out, which would in turn require even more firehouses and architects to cover the extra land being used, which further goes to make winning a mission almost impossible.
