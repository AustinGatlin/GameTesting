## Summary
  Sheepwith is a game that gives you one simple task, use a plane to rescue lost sheep and bring them back to their pen. Your character is an airplane equipped with a rope and a grabber at the end of it. The gameplay consists of navigating through various maps finding, and rescuing the sheep scattereed throughout it. In the beginning, the game is as simple as that. However, here are thirty five missions in total, with each one being harder than the last. Those missions are devided into five distinct regions, with each region providing a new and unique obsticle for you to overcome, such as wolves which leap towards and kill the sheep, a dimly lit cave, and more. 

  The gameplay mechanics are relatively simple, you fly forwards to keep yourself in the air, and you position yourself so your grabber touches the sheep to pick them up. If you touch any part of the environment you die and respawn at whatever sheep pen you most recently delievered a sheep to, and continue on. To deliver the sheep you've picked up back to a sheep pen, you have the option of either flying low enough so that the sheep touch the pen and they're automaticallyl deposited in it, or you can let go of them and hope that you let go at the right angle and velocity to have them land in the pen. 
  
## Overall Impressions
Despite it's simplicity, my impression of Sheepwith was extremely positive. The overall art and sound design was reminiscent of 90's DOS titles and quickly bread a sense of familiarity. The controls were made and felt natural, and the levels provided enough of a challenge to keep you constantly engaged which made for a great gameplay experience. 



## Things to Test

1. plane rotation. why? So controls don't go backwards when switching directions.

2. Grapple. Why? to make sure it can't get caught and make you lose.

3. Time only moves on screen. Why? Because some events need to not occur before you have a chance to see/do something about it.

4. Sheep can't get in pen by themselves. Why? Because it would be game breaking if they could
