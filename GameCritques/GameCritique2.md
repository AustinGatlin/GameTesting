## Summary 
  Raze 2 is a browser-based 2D side-scrolling  shooter game. The primary activity of Raze 2, like most shooters, is to shoot and kill as
many members of the enemy team as possible as quickly as possible. Raze 2, despite just being a flash game, has an immense amount of 
effort put into it. It features two seperate campaigns that each span 15 missions, and a story to go with each one of them. The story
is relatively simple and rarely effects gameplay, but it further shows how much time and care was put into this game. It also features 
a custome match mode, where you can choose what game mode to play, how many players, which map to play on and even what types of weapons
are allowed. 

  The thing that really makes Raze 2 stand out against other games of the genre is it's gampeplay. The controls and gameplay options at first glance are rather standard, but taking a closer look into the game you realize that there's more to it than you might originally think. Your character can run, double jump switch weapons, shoot and use special ability just like in most games of the genre; however, what truly makes Raze 2 unique is in the variaty and amount of choice it gives you. In every match there are seven different weapon types for you to pick up, all having their unique pros and cons and each being useful for certain situations. This ranges from shotguns for close range all the way to snipers for long range and rocket launchers for groups of enemies. 
  
  The second feature of the gameplay that makes the game so unique for its genre is its AI. The AI is, admittedly, very flawed, however it is also far better than a game like this would normally have. They usually play towards each missions objectives very well, trying to capture your flag in capture-the-flag and so forth. The AI also is surprisingly lifelike at times. There's alawys a hint of mystery as to  what their next move will be, preventing you from exploiting their movement patterns like many game's AI do. The maitn flaw with them, however, is their accuracy and reaction time. Unlike many similar games, Raze 2's AI does not behave sluggishly and ungracefully like a fish trying to walk; instead, the AI are superhuman most of the time, reacting in a moment's notice and usually with absolute precision. This means that the game has a tendency to be ridiculously hard at times.
  
  Lastly, the final feature that puts Raze 2 above its peers, it's customization. Raze 2 offers a vary wide range of abilities and weapons to choose from, even from within its seven different weapon types. Within each of the weapon types are four to five different weapons, each having it's own advantages and disadvantages over the other choices. One sniper has the ability to shoot through multiple people damaging anyone in it's path, but dealing out minimal damage, while another deals extreme damage and can kill many enemies with a single bullet, but it only has a magazine capacity of one, making you have to reload after every shot. The special abilities have similar customization as well, some abilities, like teleporting, help you to stay alive while other, such as trip mines, help you to kill your oponents. 
  
  
  ## Final Thoughts
  
  Raze 2 is a game that I've played for years and keep coming back to. The AI is extremely difficult, which can be frustrating at times or a fun challenge at other times, however the shear amount of weapon variety makes you always feel like there's something more you can do to overcome the challenge so instead of becoming overly frustrating, the game motivates you to play more to find what loadout works for that situation. The amount of variety in the maps, weapons, abilities and game mode has kept me coming back to Raze 2 for years and has made a lasting impression about how much putting care into even something small like a flash game can be the difference between a forgetable game and a great game. 
  
  ## What I would test
  
1. The first thing I would want to test in Raze 2 is the weapons. With such a wide variety of weapons and what each weapon does and the fact that the guns are part of the core gameplay, it makes sense that these should be thouroughly tested. Tests would include making sure that guns don't have friendly fire, unless it was an intended feature. Another would be to make sure that the guns that track movement only track enemies and don't circle back on the player. Games like Raze 2 live or die by their gunplay, so it needs to be right and correctly tested if the game is going to be fun.
 
2. The second thing that I would test in a game like Raze 2 is the game's AI. The parts I would be most concerned about would be their general behavior rather than other things such as response time, detection etc. The reason I would test their behavior would be to ensure that they reacted according to game mode and other circumstances. In capture the flag do they attempt to get the other teams flag or do they just behave as if there was no flag at all? Do they react to the other AI on their team as if they were oponents or do they ignore each other? If the AI is behaving correctly, the game would play more naturally and be far more immersive than if you could easilty exploit broken behaviors.

3. The last thing that should be tested is the playability, specifically difficulty. The game, while incredibly fun, suffers from a lack of playtesting. While most of the weapons and abilities are rather well balanced and give a good sense of fairness from player to AI, some of the missions themselves are simply too hard. Two missions in particular come to mind immediately when I think of this games difficulty, and the reason being is that they seem practically impossible. The missions typically only last around 5-6 minutes each, however there are two that I spent hours trying to beat each, and even after that I could still only beat one of them. Difficulty testing is something that every game needs to go through. When done properly, you get a well balanced game that is fun and appropriately challenging throughout. When done wrong or not at all, you get the last two missions of Raze 2, fun gameplay, but ultimately frustratingly difficult missions
