## Summary 
  Raze 2 is a browser-based 2D side-scrolling  shooter game. The primary activity of Raze 2, like most shooters, is to shoot and kill as
many members of the enemy team as possible as quickly as possible. Raze 2, despite just being a flash game, has an immense amount of 
effort put into it. It features two seperate campaigns that each span 15 missions, and a story to go with each one of them. The story
is relatively simple and rarely effects gameplay, but it further shows how much time and care was put into this game. It also features 
a custome match mode, where you can choose what game mode to play, how many players, which map to play on and even what types of weapons
are allowed.
