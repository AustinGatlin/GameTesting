## Summary 

  Blitz Brigade is a mobile, Free-to-play FPS. Blitz Bridage, unlike most FPS games, let alone mobile, free-to-play FPS games, is a hero based game. Like most FPS games, it has all of the usual FPS elements, gun and map variety, and most of the typical game modes such as free for all and capture the flag. Like most free-to-play games, it has no shortage of microtransactions for unlocking weapons and heroes early and for consumables. Unlike most games like it, while it does shove these microtransaction in your face, it's far less predatory about it. There's a general sense that you don't necessarily need those extra items to have a fair playing field and to enjoy the game. 

  The gameplay of Blitz Brigade itself isn't entirely unique or remarkable, however, combined with several other factors, it does make the game stand out. Like any FPS, you can walk, run, jump and shoot. Each hero, however, has it's own special ability that it can use, however, the cool down times are rather high for them so they are closer to ultimate abilities. These ultimate abilities can range from a protection shield that essentially blocks all damage for several seconds to invisibility. The most defining feature of Blitz Brigade, however, is it's level designs. Each map is only available for specific game modes, so a free for all map won't be available in capture the flag, and the game uses that to its advantage. Each map feels like it was made for the game mode you're playing it on, rather than a generic maps that feel out of place on some game modes. The maps themselves are impressive as well, not only are they made for their intended game modes, but they are rather large and well desinged. 
  
  ## Final Thoughts
  
  Blitz Brigade both stands out and fits in with it's genre. It stands out in just how much there is to it for a free-to-play mobile game and how well made and enjoyable it is. It fits in, however, when it comes to microtransactions. The game's microtransactions are practically shoved down the throat of anyone who plays it. The microtransaction give you some of the game's special currency, that admittedly they do allow you to earn for free. While the amount of advertising for buying that currency is relatively small, every single item in the game is attached to it in some way, and the game lets you know that. Even when you're simply waiting to respawn, the game gives you the option to spend its currency to respawn instantly, instead of waiting the full eight seconds. That being said, though, Blitz Brigade doesn't actually force you to buy anything to be able to fully enjoy the game. While they certainly do encourage you to spend money, the game still has plenty to offer even if you never spend a cent on it. It also seems like you can unlock everything in game without spending money if you play enough, however it was rather vague on that so it might be that certain weapons might be locked behind a paywall. 
  
  The game's biggest fault, however, isn't the amount of microtransactions, it's actually the number of player per loby. Blitz Brigade only allows for up to 12 players on team based game modes. That seems like plenty of players at first glance, but as mentioned before, the maps are rather large. This makes even a full loby seem like it's empty. Each map is beautifully made, with very impressive graphics for a five year old mobile game, and the design makes the maps seem rather grand, as if they're meant for a large scale battle at least 18 players. But there are only up to 12 players, which is perhaps this game's biggest missed opportunity and the biggest fault in what is otherwise a very fun game.
