## Summary 
  Creeping is, as its title, description, game mechanics and tutorials will all tell you, is a stealth based game. In creeping, you 
assume the role of a character sneaking past or eliminating armed guards to get to the next scene. Creepin doesn't waste any time getting
to where it wants to be; the tutorial is extremely brief and the point, there's no reason given for why you're sneaking past these guards 
and there's no explination as to why you can teleport, something I'll discuss more later. Once it finishes teaching you the basic controls
and mechanisms, it mostly just leaves you alone to complete the various levels, occasionally giving you hints.

  The game mechanics present in Creeping are mostly pretty standard, with only one sticking out. You can run, jump, duck, teleport, 
make noise, backstab and shoot. The movement controls are fluid easy to control, making navigating the scenes feel natural. The teleport
ability allows you to teleport a short distance in the direction you're facing, even through objects. This is, by far, what makes this game 
stick out, adding an extra layer of possibilities for how to handle different situations. Making noise, as implied, atracts the attention of
nearby guards, allowing you to either sneak past them or stab them in the back for a silent kill. Finally, there's shooting. Creeping gives 
you a low power pistol with unlimited amo. Through killing certain gaurds with different weapons, you are allowed to cary a second weapon
that has limited amo, amo that can only be replenished through killing other guards that have the same weapon. While the game does give 
you guns to shoot alerted enemies with, the enemies do significant damage and have perfect or near accuracy and if a firefight continues 
for too long, more guards are likely to arrive, meaning that when possible, stealth is the better option.

## Final Thoughts
  I can't say whether I like Creeping or not without first addressing the elephant in the room, which I have been deliberately avoiding 
until now. The single biggest flaw with creeping has nothing to do with any glitch, technical limitation or even unenjoyable mechanic. 
The biggest problem that Creeping has is level design. As mentioned previousuly, Creeping doesn't shy away from telling you that it's a
stealth game, however, the level design doesn't support that. Many of the levels, starting from almost the moment the tutorials end, are 
almost impossible, some being entirely impossible to beat with only stealth. The game even goes so far as to set boss battles, with the
boss spotting you the moment you enter the scene, something that I find to be very odd in a game that makes every effort to tell you that
it's a stealth game. 

  So, the answer to the question of do I find creeping fun is both yes and no. It's a game that's core experience is extremely enjoyable
 and well made, but the level design ruins the entire expeince. I could say that the game was fun with certainty if only the level design
 had mached the design of the game's mechanics, but in the end, those poor design choices spoiled what might have otherwise been a great game.
