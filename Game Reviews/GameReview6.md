## Summary

Me and My Dinosaur is a 2D, sidescroller-platformer. Me and My Dinosaur is a deceptively simple game. In order to win, you and your dinosaur need to reach the sign at the end of each level. Your character moves like any sidescroller with the WASD keys. Your dinosaur, however, moves when you throw him a bone. To throw him a bone all you have to do is click on the screen. If it lands on the right type of terrain, your dinosaur will move directly towards it. If it lands on the wrong terrain, then the bone dissapears and your dinosaur stays where he is at. Unlike your character, your dinosaur cannot jump, only move left and right. However, each level has jump pads and buttons to help you and challenge you. Some buttons and jump pads can only be activated by your character, and some can only be activated by your dinosaur. 

Me and My Dinsosaur is also very much a puzzle game. You don't just go walking through the level and win, you have to slow down and carefully consider how to beat each level, otherwise you may have to restart. The puzzles are in the form of special terrains that effect you and your dinosaur differently. For example, many levels have spikes on the floot, walls, or cieling. These spikes kill your character instantly, but have no effect on your dinosaur. The levels have you going through small puzzles that involve thinking through when and where to move your dinosaur, and how you interact with him as well.

## Final Thoughts
Despite Me and My Dinosaurs very simplistic concept and execution, it has a certain charm to it that few games have. Moreover, it is also far more difficult than your first impression would leave you to believe. It's not a perfect game, however. Due to the inexperience of the creator of the game there are some aspects that are somewhat inconsistent, such as your dinosaurs movements and platform navigation. These issues aren't game breaking, but certainly noticeable.  In the end, however, it is a very enjoyable game that I will definitely remember for a long time.
