## Summary
  The first and probably most notable thing about Acid Bunny is it's setup and story. Depending on your personal, family or even friend's history, you may find it funny and laughable, or you may find it offensive. The setup goes that you're the runt of the litter of bunnies with a drug addicted mother. Being the runt, you got none of your mother's milk as a child, and as a restult, was the bunny out of the litter to not be addicted to drugs; however, you still did suffer from occasional random hallucinations. During one of your hallucinations, you accidentally kill one of your friends, a stuffed bear. In order to bring your friend back to life, you must find 24 spools of thread hidden throughout the game's map.
  
  Acid Bunny is a traditional flash-based Adventure-platformer. The game gives you abilities and obsitacles that are relatively typical in adventure-platformers, such as double jumping, throwing objects and even riding certain objects in the game, such as a minecart and hot-air-balloon. However, the way the game handles it's simplicity is done extremely well. It's very well paced, with a very small learning curve, yet ever increasing difficulty. Acid Bunny rarely handed you anything, and even then it's only to show you the game's basics, yet it never makes anything impossible either. It gives you an open map to explore where you can finish any challenge at any point in the game, but it also gives a natural progression of where to start and where to go next, with the locations it leads you towards first being far easier than the locations it takes you to later. 

## Final Thoughts
  Looking past Acid Bunny's rather bizarre story and setup, it's an extremely well made and designed game, and certainly one of the best flash-based adventure-platformers that I've played in a very long time. Acid Bunny gives you the freedom to go anyewhere on the map and complete any challenge in the game as soon as you start playing. Typically, games that give you the freedom to explore and attempt any challenege immediately also withold certain items from your possesion so that you can only complete them when the game has decided you've done enough of the other challenges first, and I thought Acid Bunny was a very refreshing change from that formula. 
  
  My only complaint with Acid Bunny is something that, given it was made using Flash, was probably unavoidable. And that was the small, but definitely noticeable, amount of time that it took to load different screens. Normally, that problem wouldn't even be worth mentioning, however several of the game's challenges require you to make precise movements while also accounting for that small, inconsistent, delay. Apart from that one small complaint, Acid Bunny is a truly enjoyable game.
